> Homework for sophomore of SDCS, SYSU. 
> MySQL courses by Yongdong Zhang, SDCS, SYSU. 
> Author Nino Lau.

## Introduce

This project provides implementations of some OS problems. All of the experiments are based on the ppt listed in the references folder. Sometimes the code cannot be executed well due to some limitation. When this happens, you can artificially change the file type from .c to .cpp. 

## Contains

All of the experiments' code and reports are in the [experiments](https://github.com/LovelyBuggies/C_OperatingSystem_Experiments/tree/master/experiments) folder.

* ex0 gives some preparations you are expected to conduct before executing the following experiments.
* ex1 includes experiments related to process communication.
* ex2 provides some multi-processes examples.
* ex3 steps into synchronous area, and uses semaphores in this task.
* ex4 implements the famous Reader-Writer problems, which is one of the famous multi-programming problems (finding other famous problem there: [Q1](https://blog.csdn.net/qq_24451605/article/details/49563045); [Q2](https://blog.csdn.net/qq_24451605/article/details/49652573); [Q3](https://blog.csdn.net/qq_24451605/article/details/49658607); [Q4](https://blog.csdn.net/qq_24451605/article/details/49661305); [Q5](https://blog.csdn.net/qq_24451605/article/details/49668201)).
